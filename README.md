If you want to, you can schedule a job on crontab

 1. Entry: Minute when the process will be started [0-60]
 2. Entry: Hour when the process will be started [0-23]
 3. Entry: Day of the month when the process will be started [1-28/29/30/31]
 4. Entry: Month of the year when the process will be started [1-12]
 5. Entry: Weekday when the process will be started [0-6] [0 is Sunday]

 every each x minute = */x    

 So according to this spec 0 14 * * 0  would run 14:00 every Sunday.
